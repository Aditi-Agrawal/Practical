    <p>It is an open-source and free framework of CSS which helps in 
        directing a responsive device friendly mobile first front-end 
        webpage development tool. Bootstrap includes the CSS 
        (Cascading Style Sheets), and an optional JavaScript supported 
        design template (plug-ins) that deals with typography, 
        implementation of buttons, forms and various other components 
        for the user interface. This framework helps in faster web development 
        and support developers in creating responsive web pages at a quicker pace.</p>
        <h3>History of Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>Twitter Blueprint was the first name of Bootstrap and was developed at Twitter 
            by Mr. Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton. It got released as an open source 
            product in August 2011 on GitHub. The framework was mainly designed for 
            encouraging reliability and uniformity of web pages across internal tools. 
            Before the existence of Bootstrap, for making responsive sites and interface 
            development, various external libraries were used, that not only brings 
            inconsistency but also gave rise to the heavy maintenance burden.</p>
