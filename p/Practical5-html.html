    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language.
         HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext 
         defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to 
         define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web 
         pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved 
         the markup available for documents and has introduced application 
         programming interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM).Hypertext 
         refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. 
         Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
         As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use 
         HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web 
         browser how to structure it to display.</p>
