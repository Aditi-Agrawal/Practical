    <p>jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
        Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.
        Note: The only library available today that meets the needs of both designer types and programmer types is jQuery.
        It is incredibly popular, which is to say it has a large community of users and a healthy amount of contributors who participate as developers and evangelists.
        It normalizes the differences between web browsers so that you don’t have to.
        It is intentionally a lightweight footprint with a simple yet clever plugin architecture.
        Its repository of plugins is vast and has seen steady growth since jQuery’s release.
        Its API is fully documented, including inline code examples, which in the world of JavaScript libraries is a luxury. Heck, any documentation at all was a luxury for years.
        It is friendly, which is to say it provides helpful ways to avoid conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.
